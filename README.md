This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon error in Python that can easily be missed by developers.  The code attempts to handle TypeErrors using a try-except block. However, it neglects to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception, which can lead to unexpected program termination.

The bug.py file shows the erroneous code.  The bugSolution.py file presents the corrected version of this code, demonstrating how to handle both TypeError and ZeroDivisionError exceptions effectively.
